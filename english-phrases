dapper, half decent, pull off,
out there, gray area, repurcission,
damned if you do, damned if you dnt,
a little bit of goes a long way,
to do your part,do right by something,
both sides of the issue,the tip of the iceberg,


absence makes the heart grow fonder,

wired differently
man are from mars and women are from venus
cant live with them, cant live without them- them is pronounced casullay as em

battle - baddle.
trouble in paradise
butt head with someone. buttheading with him/her- bu(tt) head
to duke it out- fight with someone
talk it out rather than duke it out. (du-kit-out)
hothead
putting up walls - not talking anymore or not listening 
make up for something
it takes two to tango - t=d
make a relationship work-make it work
to lose touch- lost touch
dont go to bed angry.
